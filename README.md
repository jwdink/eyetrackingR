## !! Warning: Unmaintained

This package has not been updated in several years and is no longer actively maintained. There are several outstanding issues. If anyone is interested in taking over package maintenance, please reach out.

Update (Aug 27, 2021): @samhforbes is now maintaining [a fork of eyetrackingR](https://github.com/samhforbes/eyetrackingr) on Github that will soon become the source repository for the CRAN `eyetrackingR` package.

## Eye-tracking Data: Cleaning, Analysis, & Visualization

- Jacob Dink (jacobwdink@gmail.com)
- Brock Ferguson (brock.ferguson@gmail.com)


This package is designed to make dealing with eye-tracking data easier. It addresses tasks along the pipeline from raw data to analysis and visualization. It offers several popular types of analyses, including growth-curve analysis, onset-contingent reaction time analyses, as well as several non-parametric bootstrapping approaches.

```

## Usage

EyetrackingR only requires that your data is in an R dataframe and has a few necessary columns. For that reason, **eyetrackingR is compatible with any eyetracker,** so long as you can export your data to a table and import it into R. See the [preparing your data](http://www.eyetracking-r.com/vignettes/preparing_your_data) vignette.

Once your data is in R, you  can prepare it for eyetrackingR by running the `make_eyetrackingr_data` function, e.g.:

```
data <- make_eyetrackingr_data(your_original_data, 
                       participant_column = "ParticipantName",
                       trial_column = "Trial",
                       time_column = "Timestamp",
                       trackloss_column = "TrackLoss",
                       treat_non_aoi_looks_as_missing = TRUE
)
```

From here, all of eyetrackingR's functionality becomes available for this data. Check out [the eyetrackingR workflow](http://www.eyetracking-r.com/workflow) to get an accesible overview of this functionality, or check out [the vignettes](http://www.eyetracking-r.com/vignettes) for guides on how to clean your data, visualize it, and perform analyses.
